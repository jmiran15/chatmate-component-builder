```text
mark s as explored, all other vertices as unexplored
S := a stack data structure, initialized with s 
while S is not empty do
  pop the vertex from the top of S, call it v 
  for each edge (v, w) in v's neighborhood do
    if w is unexplored then
      mark w as explored 
      push w to the top of S
