# Quadratic Sorts

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

- Describe **Selection**, **Insertion**, and **Bubble** sorts at high level.
- Trace each sorting algorithm on a given sequence of data.
- Understand each sorting algorithm well enough to implement them.
- Recognize the effect of applying a particular sorting strategy on a data sequence.
- Work out the asymptotic complexity of each sorting algorithm.
- Identify the number of **comparisons** and **swaps** for each of these algorithms in the worst case, based on the data size.
- Understand the use and operation of Java's **Comparable** interface.
