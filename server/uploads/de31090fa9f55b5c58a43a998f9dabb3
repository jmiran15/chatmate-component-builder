* Explain why we use Big-Oh notation.

**Algorithm Efficiency**: how an algorithm utilizes resources, namely the amount of time it uses. 

**Random Access Machine or RAM**: a hypothetical computer with infinite memory and accessing memory is "free." All basic operations take one step. Loops/functions are the compositions of many single-step operations.

 **Algorithm Runtime**: the number of (RAM) steps as a function of input size. We consider worst-case analysis unless specified otherwise.

<div class="note">

It can be difficult to precisely work out the exact number of RAM instructions executed by a program.

</div>

We will now introduce the **Big-Oh** (read it as "big O") notation which allows us to describe <u>the growth rate of functions.</u> The Big-Oh notion makes it easier to compare the runtime of algorithms without having to precisely count the number of (RAM) steps they take.
