# A pragmatic definition of "efficiency"

* Describe what is meant by the efficiency of algorithms.

</details></div>

There are multiple ways to solve a computational problem, as we have seen with linear and binary search. Measuring their tradeoffs involves analyzing their **efficiency**.

<div class="note">

Efficiency here means how an algorithm utilizes resources, namely the amount of time (and space) it uses. Moreover, we want to know how its resource consumption will _scale_ with increasing input size.

</div> 

We need to establish the vocabulary and the required mathematical machinery to talk about the efficiency of algorithms. To that end, we introduce the **RAM** model of computation in this chapter and **asymptotic notation** in the next chapter.
