# Merge Sort

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Explain and trace the operations of **MergeSort** on a particular data sequence.
* Implement MergeSort efficiently (allowing $\Omicron(n)$ auxiliary space).
* Analyze the best- and worst-case space and time efficiency of merge phase and MergeSort overall.
* Determine how to optimize the merge phase to be $\Omicron(1)$ for sorted subarrays and why this results in $\Omicron(n)$ for already sorted starting sequences.
