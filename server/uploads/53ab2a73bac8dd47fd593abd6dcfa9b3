# Asymptotic Analysis

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Explain what is meant by **asymptotic complexity analysis** of an algorithm.
* Contrast between **time vs. space complexity**.
* Express the space requirements for a given code segment as a function of the input size in the worst-case scenario.
* Express the formal, **mathematical definition of Big-Oh**.
* Use the mathematical definition of Big-Oh to prove the asymptotic running time of a given program.
* Express the **mathematical definition of Big Omega**.
* Use the mathematical definition of Big Omega to prove the asymptotic running time of a given program.
* Recognize that Big-Oh and big Omega are **not** necessarily tight bounds.
* Recognize growth rate type (upper or lower bound) is different from worst-case vs. best-case analysis.
* Express the **mathematical definition of Big Theta**.
* Use the definition of Big Theta to show the asymptotic running time of a given program.
* Enumerate various asymptotic notations used in this course.
* Elaborate on the benefits of using asymptotic notation and worst-case analysis to study the computational complexity of algorithms.

> This topic will be the most mathematically demanding part of this course. However, once you understand the intuition behind formalism, it becomes a lot easier to deal with.
