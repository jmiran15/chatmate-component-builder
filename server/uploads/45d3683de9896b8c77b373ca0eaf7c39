# Limited AccessÂ Data Structures

* Explain what is meant by the limited-access data structure.

</details></div>

An *array* is a **random-access** data structure, where each element can be accessed directly and in constant time. Random access is critical to many algorithms, for example, to binary search.

* A typical illustration of random access is a book &mdash; each book page can be reached independently of others. 

A *linked list* is a **sequential-access** data structure, where each element can be accessed only by traversing the list. 

* A typical illustration of sequential access is a roll of paper or tape &mdash; all prior material must be unrolled to get to the data you want.

<div class="note">

A *stack* and a *queue* are examples of _restricted_ or **limited-access** data structures. You can only access (add, read, and delete) the element at the front or back position (or both). Access to other parts is forbidden.

</div>

By limiting operations, we can create very efficient implementations.
