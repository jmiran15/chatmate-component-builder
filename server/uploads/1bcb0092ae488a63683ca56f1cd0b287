# Priority Queue

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Describe what Priority Queue is and how it is different from standard Queue.
* Describe the core operations of Priority Queue.
* Contrast the efficiency of alternative implementation approaches (e.g., sorted/unsorted sequence vs. binary heap).
* Enumerate the structure and order properties of a **binary heap**.
* Differentiate binary search trees from binary heaps.
* Explain how a binary heap can be represented using a (ranked) array.
* Explain and trace the core operations of Priority Queue with Binary Heap implementation.
* Understand the operations of Binary Heap well enough to implement it. 
* Explain the role of the overloaded non-default constructor of PriorityQueue.
* Describe how the "natural ordering" of objects is established in Java.
* Explain the difference between `Comparable` and `Comparator` interfaces.
