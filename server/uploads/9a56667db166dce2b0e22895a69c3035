# Merge Sort: The Big Picture!

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Explain and trace the merge sort algorithm on a particular data sequence.

The merge sort applies the [divide-and-conquer strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) to sort a sequence:

1. Divide the sequence into subsequences of singletons. (A singleton sequence consists of one element, and it is considered to be already sorted.)

2. Successively merge the subsequences pairwise until a single sequence is reformed. Each merge preserves order, so each merged subsequence (and the final merged sequence) are sorted.
