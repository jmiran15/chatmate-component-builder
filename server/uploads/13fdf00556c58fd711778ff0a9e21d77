# Spanning Tree

* Describe what spanning tree.

<div class="note">

A **spanning tree** of a _connected undirected_ graph $G$ is a _subgraph_ of it (every edge in the tree belongs to $G$) that _spans_ $G$ (it includes every vertex of $G$).

</div>

Consider this graph:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/29/graph01.png" width="20%">
</div>

Every tree below is a *spanning tree* of the graph above.

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/29/graph03.png" width="95%">
</div>

As can be seen above, a graph may have several spanning trees. 

<details class="resource">
<summary>A spanning tree can be built by doing a BFS/DFS of the graph.</summary>

Recall the demo for BFS/DFS from prior chapters:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/29/graph06.png" width="100%">
</div>

The spanning trees consist (only) of the thick edges.
