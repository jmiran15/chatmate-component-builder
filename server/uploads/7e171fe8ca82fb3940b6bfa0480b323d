# Is it a tree?

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Connect the notion of a tree structure with the tree in nature!

</details></div>

Let's focus on this structure:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/16/bst02.png" width="70%">
</div>

This is a **tree**! Imagine an upside-down tree where the root (and trunk) is at the top, and the branches are growing downward! 

<div class="center">

</div>

<details class="resource">
<summary>Resources</summary>

In the context of Graph Theory (Discrete Math), the structure above is called a "rooted" tree. Read the Wikipedia entry on [Tree, Rooted tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree) for more information.

If you are interested in a detailed theoretical (mathematical) description of a tree, visit Chapter 4, Section 2 of [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction, 3rd edition](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_trees.html).
