# A data structure!

- Define "data structure."
- Distinguish between data type and data structure.

</details></div>


We've established that based on the specification of a problem, we choose whether `find` implements the linear or binary search. That choice would require organizing the (`students` array) data in different ways (sorted vs. unsorted). To establish the desired organization of data, we would have to implement `add` and `remove` methods differently. 

There are many cases where efficiently solving a problem requires such due diligence in the organization of data and implementation of operations that manipulate the data, just as in the `Roster` class.  

<div class="note">

A Data Structure encapsulates organized mechanisms for efficiently storing, accessing & manipulating data.

</div>


Thus `Roster` is indeed a data structure.


<div class="note">

In the general sense, any data type (even as simple as an integer) can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, a distinction is made so the term "data structure" means an organization or structuring for a _collection_ of data types. 

</div>

Don't fixate too much on what is a type and what is a structure; in future chapters, we will make a clear distinction by using Java Interfaces to define (abstract) data types. Data structures would be fully specified, non-abstract (concrete) classes that _implement_ those interfaces.
