<div class="note">

Each position in the hash table can be seen as a **bucket** that stores multiple entries. Thus, this approach is sometimes called **bucket hashing**.

</div>

Other names for chaining include "separate chaining" (as in collisions are dealt with using *separate* data structures), "open hashing," "close addressing" (as opposed to open addressing).
