* Describe the Queue ADT.

</details></div>

A **queue** ADT supports two main operations:

* **enqueue** which adds an element to the data structure
* **dequeue** which removes <u>the least recently added element</u> that was not yet removed

The order in which elements are removed gives rise to the term **FIFO** (first in, first out) to describe a queue.

</div>

It helps to visualize a queue as an ADT where elements are removed from the front but added to the back, analogously to when people line up to wait for goods or services.

A queue has a variety of applications such as:

* Serving requests on a shared resource, like a printer, CPU, etc.
* Any application that follows a "first come, first served" policy, e.g. customer-service, call-center/ticketing system, etc.
* Whenever it is necessary to preserve sequencing order
