# PriorityQueue: Tree Implementation

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Enumerate the structure and order properties of the binary heap.

</details></div>

We are going to explore a tree-based implementation of PriorityQueue. This implementation is called a **Binary Heap** (or simply a Heap).

A heap has the following properties:

* **Structure (shape) property**: heap is a *complete* binary tree.

<div class="note">

The structure property implies the height of the tree is $\Omicron(\lg n)$.<sup>1</sup>

</div>

* **Order (heap) property**: the element stored at each node has a higher priority (is considered "better") than its children.

<div class="note">

The order property implies the "best" element is always at the root.

</div>

<sup>1</sup> We know the height of a *perfect* binary tree is $\Omicron(\lg n)$. We should prove the complete binary tree also has a logarithmic height. We'll leave that to you to justify this. The proof is not difficult but it is beyond the scope of this course.
