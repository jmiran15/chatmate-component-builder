# Asymptotic Growth Rate

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Understand and appreciate why we do asymptotic analysis using **Big-Oh** notation.
* Use Big-Oh notation to **describe asymptotic running time** of a program when you are given the program code (or its running time as a function of input size under the RAM model).
* Use Big-Oh notation to describe the asymptotic running time of the operations of the data structures we have implemented so far.
* Understand that Big-Oh (asymptotic) notation groups runtime functions into a set of classes. 
* Enumerate **common running time functions** when the runtime is described in asymptotic (Big-Oh) notation.
* Determine the **asymptotic growth rates** of a given function using Big-Oh notation.
* **Rank** asymptotic complexities from smallest to largest.
