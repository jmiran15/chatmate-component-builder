# IndexedList ADT

* Declare an ADT using a Java interface.

</details></div>


We are now ready to declare our first ADT in this course, the `IndexedList`. 

```java
public interface IndexedList {

  void put(int index, int value);

  int get(int index);

  int length();
}
```

The `IndexedList` ADT is an abstraction of _list_, a sequential collection of elements to which you can add and access (get) data using an _index_ (a non-negative integer representing the position of data in the sequence).

Notice the method and parameter names are descriptive. You can, for example, anticipate that the `get` method returns the value stored at the given `index`. First, however, we must adequately document each method, its parameters, return value, effects, etc. We will do this next.
