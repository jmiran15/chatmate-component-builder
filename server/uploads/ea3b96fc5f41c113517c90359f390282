# Kruskal's Algorithm

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Explain how to implement Kruskal's algorithm.

</details></div>

A Greedy algorithm that grows a forest of minimum spanning trees and eventually combines them into one MST:

* Sort all edges (in ascending order, based on weight)
* Start with an empty minimum spanning tree $T = \\{\\}$.
* Pick the smallest edge and add it to $T$.
* Add next smallest edge to $T$ <u>unless it creates a cycle</u>.
* Repeat the last step until $(N â€“ 1)$ edges were added.
