# Iterator Design Pattern

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Describe the iterator design pattern.

</details></div>

The [Iterator design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) states the elements of a collection (an aggregate object) should be accessed and traversed **without exposing** its representation (underlying implementation).

<div class="note">

This goal is achieved by defining an [Iterator object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator) to traverse a data structure and access its elements. 

</div>

Iterator pattern is widely used in [Java Collection Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/) (the data structures built into Java). To implement the Iterator pattern, Java API provides two interfaces: [`Iterable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html) and [`Iterator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).

<summary>The built-in array is special!</summary>

The built-in array is an exception because it is an _iterable_ (thus can be used with the enhanced for loop) but does not implement the `Iterable` interface. The built-in array is a unique construct, a cross between primitive and objects!

Iterator pattern hides the actual implementation of a data structure from the clients of it. We will apply this pattern to the design of our data structures in this course, starting with the `IndexedList` ADT.
