The array is the most fundamental data structure built into many programming languages. Moreover, it is employed to implement many other data structures. Indeed, our first choice was to use an array to implement IndexedList ADT.

Arrays have their limitations; they are static structures and cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the data set. Furthermore, it is _expensive_ to insert/delete from the front or middle of an array. 

In this chapter, we explore another fundamental data structure called Linked List that does not have the limitations of arrays.
