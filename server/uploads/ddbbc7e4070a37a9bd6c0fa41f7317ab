* Implement the MergeSort recursively.

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Open the starter code, the `Demo.java` file and complete the implementation of `mergesort`. 
Assume the `merge` method is correctly implemented, and implement `mergesort` recursively.

**Hint:** The merge sort is naturally recursive:
* Split the sequence into two subsequences (of roughly equal size).
* Sort each subsequence recursively.
* Merge the two (sorted) sub-sequences back together.
