# Union-Find Data Structure

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Identify the operations of the Union-Find data structure.

</details></div>

A **Union-Find** data structure (a.k.a. *Disjoint-set* or *Merge-find set* data structure) categorizes objects into _disjoint_ (non-overlapping) sets. It facilitates checking if two objects belong to the same set. 

<div class="note">

It provides <u>near-constant-time</u> operations to add new sets, merge existing sets, and determine whether elements are in the same set.

</div>

The most popular application of this data structure is to check whether one node in a graph can be reached from another, e.g., in  Kruskal's algorithm, to avoid forming cycles.
