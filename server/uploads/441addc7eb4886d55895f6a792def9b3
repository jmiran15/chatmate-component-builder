# Minimum Spanning Tree

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Describe why constructing minimum spanning trees is useful.

</details></div>

When finding spanning trees of a graph, we may be interested in those where the total edge weight is minimal among all the possible spanning trees, a so-called minimum weight spanning tree (MST). 

<div class="note">

A **minimum spanning tree** of a _weighted_ graph $G$ is a spanning tree of it with the minimum possible total edge weight.

</div>

Consider the following _weighted_ graph:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/29/graph04.png" width="20%">
</div>

Every tree below is a *minimum spanning tree* of the graph above.

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/29/graph05.png" width="75%">
</div>

As can be seen, an MST is not necessarily unique. There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same total weight. However, if each edge has a distinct weight, there will be only one unique minimum spanning tree.

**Minimum Spanning Tree Problem**

Given a *connected*, *undirected weighted* graph $G = (V, E, w)$, the minimum (weight) spanning tree problem requires finding a spanning tree of minimum weight, where the weight of a tree $T$ is defined as the sum of the wight of all its edges:

$$
w(T) = \sum_{e \in E(T)} w(e)
$$

</div>

We will look at two algorithms to solve the MST problem:

* Prim's Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algorithm
