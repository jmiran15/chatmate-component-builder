* Identify adjacent vertices in a graph.

Two vertices that are connected directly with an edge are called **adjacent** vertices. In the graph below, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are adjacent; $v_2$ and $v_3$ are adjacent; however, $v_1$ and $v_3$ are not adjacent.

Two <u>adjacent</u> vertices forming an edge are said to be **incident** to that edge. In the graph below, $v_1$ is _incident to_ the edges $e_1$ and $e_3$.

**Outgoing** edges of a vertex are _directed_ edges that the vertex is the origin.

**Incoming** edges of a vertex are _directed_ edges that the vertex is the destination.

In the graph above, $\text{out}(v_2)=\\{ e_2\\}$ and $\text{in}(v_2)=\\{e_1 \\}$. Note that $v_1$ has no incoming edges and $v_3$ has no outgoing edges.
