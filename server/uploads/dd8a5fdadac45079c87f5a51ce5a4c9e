# Balanced BST

* Describe what balance property is in the context of BST structure.

</details></div>

For efficiency, we shall restrict the height of a BST so that it is $\Omicron(\lg n)$ instead of the worst-case $\Omicron(n)$.

**Balancing to the rescue:** The tree structure is *adjusted* as necessary to maintain a better balance and resulting height.

A BST is balanced when it has the following property:

<div class="note">

For any node, the heights of the node's left and right subtrees are either equal or differ by at most $1$.

</div>

The above is often referred to as the **balance property**. Thus, a BST that maintains the balance property is a balanced BST or simply a **BBST**.
