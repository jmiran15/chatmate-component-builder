# Linked List

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Define what a **Linked List** is.
* Enumerate the advantages & disadvantages of a linked list-based vs. an array-based implementation.
* **Trace** the basic operations of a (singly) linked-list implementation.
* Understand the basic operations of a (singly) linked list well enough to **implement** them.
* Implement an iterator for a (singly) linked list.
* Appreciate that members of a **static nested class** (Node for Linked List) can be accessed by the outer class, but not the other way around.
* Implement `IndexedList` operations with a (singly) linked list implementation (`LinkedIndexedList`).
