# Graph: Sparse vs Dense

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Distinguish between sparse vs. dense graphs.

</details></div>

A **sparse** graph has relatively few edges, i.e., $M$ is closer to the lower bound $\Omega(N)$.

A **dense** graph has many edges, i.e., $M$ is closer to the upper bound $\Omicron(N^2)$.

<div class="note">

Graph representation (implementation) choice will depend on whether the problem at hand is more likely to be a sparse or dense graph!

</div>

If your graph is sparse, adjacency list representation will be more efficient (in terms of space complexity).
