<summary>Solution</summary>

Yes! <span class="highlight"> Inheritance is **transitive**.</span> If `GradStudent` is a sub-class of `Student` and `PhdStudent` is a sub-class of `GradStudent`, then `PhdStudent` is also a sub-class of `Student`. 

<div class="note">

The chain of inheritance relationships is known as "**multi-level inheritance**" (where a sub-class is inherited from another sub-class). 

</div>

Multi-level inheritance is supported in Java.
