<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Trace Single Left Rotation.

Consider the following BST:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/19/avl53.png" width="60%">
</div>

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Start from the leaf (6) and visit the parent nodes back to the root. As soon as you see an imbalanced node, apply rotation to fix it.

Let's note the heights and balance factors in the original BST:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/19/avl54.png" width="65%">
</div>

We can perform a left rotation to bring $4$ to the left of $5$:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/19/avl55.png" width="65%">
</div>

We then perform another left rotation to bring $3$ to the left of $5$: 

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/19/avl56.png" width="50%">
</div>
