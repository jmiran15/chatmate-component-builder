# Comparison-based Algorithm: Decision Tree

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Relate the process of any comparison-based algorithm to a decision tree.

<div class="note">

The operations of any comparison-based algorithm can be viewed as a *tree* of all possible comparison outcomes and resulting output. Such a tree is called a _decision tree_ (or a comparison tree).

Recall we illustrated the operation of binary search as a decision tree:

<summary>Explanation</summary>

Assume the target value is $x$; we start the search by comparing the value of $x$ to the value of the element in the middle of the sequence, $9$. If $x = 9$ then the search ends. Otherwise, there are <u>two</u> possible outcomes:
1. $x>9$ in which case we will explore the right half of the sequence (the next comparison will be against $17$). 
2. $x<9$ in which case we will explore the left half of the sequence (the next comparison will be against $5$)

This process is repeated until the search succeeds or fails (no more values are left to compare).

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure that models the comparisons made and their possible outcomes (consequences).
