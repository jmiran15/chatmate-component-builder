* Setting the stage for Binary Search Tree

</details></div>

We will learn about a new data structure called **Binary Search Tree** (hereafter abbreviated as **BST**). We will use BST to implement the **OrderedSet ADT**, and we claim this implementation can, potentially, be more efficient than the alternatives we have explored.

The idea behind the new data structure is to create **non-linear** *linked nodes*. By doing so, we can perform a binary search (with the expected efficiency, as in a sorted array). However, _insertion_ and _removeal_ are also efficient (as we don't need to shift elements).
