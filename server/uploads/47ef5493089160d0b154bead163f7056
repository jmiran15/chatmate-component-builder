* Describe why inheritance is not a symmetric relationship.

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> We could make `Student` a sub-class of `GradStudent`. Is there any reason to prefer this to the alternative or the other way around?

<summary>Solution</summary>

<span class="highlight">Inheritance is **not symmetric**.</span> The `GradStudent` has properties not shared with `Student` (i.e. the  advisor). 
If we make `Student` a sub-class of the `GradStudent`, it will inherit the `advisor` field along with its setter and getter methods which are not meant to be part of a `Student` object. 

**PS.** I know undergraduate students may have advisors. Still, I've made the simplifying assumption that they don't, at least not in a sense a graduate student has a _thesis advisor_.
