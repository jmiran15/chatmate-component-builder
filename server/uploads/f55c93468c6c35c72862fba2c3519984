```text
mark s as explored, all other vertices as unexplored
Q := a queue data structure, initialized with s 
while Q is not empty do
  remove the vertex from the front of Q, call it v 
  for edge (v, w) in v's neighborhood do
    if w is unexplored then
      mark w as explored 
      add w to the end of Q
