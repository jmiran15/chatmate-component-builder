# Heap Structure Property

* Describe the structure property of a binary heap.

</details></div>

A **complete binary tree** is one where the tree is "full" on all levels except possibly the last, and the last level has all its nodes to the left side. (Contrast this with a _perfect_ binary tree that you have learned about in an earlier chapter.)

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Which of the following is a complete binary tree?

The two on the top are complete binary trees, but the bottom two are not. The bottom left one does not have all its nodes at the last level to the left side. In the bottom right one, level 2 is not full!
