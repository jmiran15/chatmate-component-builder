# Map ADT & BBST

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Explain and trace the core operations of **Map**.
* Describe the difference between similar operations (`put` and `insert`).
* Differentiate between similar data structures: Map, Dictionary, OrderedMap.
* Implement Map using an ArrayList internally.
* Implement OrderedMap using a BST (without balancing strategies).
* Describe what **balance property** is (in the context of BST structure).
* Identify the height and **balance factor** of binary search tree nodes.
* Differentiate binary trees, binary search trees, and **balanced binary search trees** based on the structure (balance) and ordering properties.
