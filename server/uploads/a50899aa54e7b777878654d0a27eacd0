**Shortest Path Problem**

**Input**: Graph $G=(V, E)$, and a starting vertex $s \in V$.\
**Goal:** Identify the shortest path from $s$ to every vertex in $G$.

There are many variations of the Shortest Path problem:
* weighted vs. unweighted (all weights equal)
* cyclic vs. acyclic
* positive weights only vs. negative weights allowed 
* single source vs. multi-source
* etc. 

The (modified) BFS can be used to solve the problem for the single-source unweighted graph. Dijkstra's algorithm can be used for a single-source weighted graph (when weights are non-negative). There are other algorithms for other variants of the problem. For instance, the [Bellman–Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm), the [Floyd–Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm), the [Johnson's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson's_algorithm), the [Viterbi's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm), etc.

<!--

- The BFS solution works even for cyclic graphs!

- Dijkstra's algorithm works only when weights are non-negative.
