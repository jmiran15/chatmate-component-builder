# Best Operation

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Trace the best operation of Priority Queue with Binary Heap implementation.

</details></div>

As stated earlier, the "best" element is always at the root of a binary heap implementation of PriorityQueue ADT. 

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/20/heap03.png" width="70%">
</div>

Therefore `best()` is $\Omicron(1)$ operation returning the value stored at root.
