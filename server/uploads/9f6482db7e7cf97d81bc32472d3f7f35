- Explain what is meant by asymptotic complexity analysis of an algorithm.

</details></div>

Asymptotic analysis (or asymptotic complexity analysis) uses asymptotic notation (like Big-Oh) to describe the _computational complexity_ of an algorithm. 

The computational complexity of an algorithm is (generally) about how it consumes computational resources, namely time complexity and space complexity.

<div class="note">

Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm needs to run as a function of its input size. 

</div>

We've measured time complexity so far. Next, we will look at space complexity!
