# Map ADT: The Abstraction

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Explain the core operations of Map ADT.

A Map is a collection of `<key, value>` pairs. Keys must be **unique** and **immutable**.

Maps are also known as "dictionaries," or "associative arrays," or "symbol tables" in other contexts. 
Some references distinguish between Map and Dictionary by defining the latter as a Map in which duplicate keys are allowed.

<div class="note">

The core operations of a Map involve "insertion," "removal," and "update" of `<key, value>` pairs, as well as the _lookup_ of a value associated with a particular key.

</div>

Maps are a very popular abstraction. To understand the versatility of Maps, consider that Arrays can be seen as Maps where keys are the array indices. <span class="highlight">In a way, a Map is a (fast) "key lookup" data structure that offers a flexible means of indexing into its element.</span> Some programming languages, such as Go and Python, have "built-in" Maps.

I talked a lot about it, using a table with two columns, "key" and "value," and also elaborating on "immutable" and why it is important.
