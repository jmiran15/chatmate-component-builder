* Implement the Merge process. 

</details></div>

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Open the starter code, the `Demo.java` file and complete the implementation of `merge`. Your implementation must have time complexity of $\Omicron(n)$. 

**Hint:** It is possible to implement merge with $\Omicron(1)$ auxiliary space (so the whole merge sort process would be _in-place_). However, it adds unnecessary complexity to the implementation, which gets the essential idea behind the linear-time merge process. So, feel free to implement `merge` with $\Omicron(n)$ auxiliary space.
