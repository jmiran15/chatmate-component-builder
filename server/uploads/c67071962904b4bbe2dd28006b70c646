# JUnit Framework

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

- Apply the JUnit framework to unit testing Java code.
- Define what a unit test is.

</details></div>


In this course, we use a Java library called [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to write and run tests. 

<div class="note">

JUnit provides _annotations_ to write tests using the familiar structure and syntax of Java classes and methods but treats them as "tests" once annotated as one.

</div>

The library is included in the `lib` folder, which we provide as the starter/solution for homework and chapters. 

Let's create a test class for the IndexedList ADT:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class IndexedListTest {

  @Test
  void put() {
  }

  @Test
  void get() {
  }

  @Test
  void length() {
  }
}
```

You must store the `IndexedListTest.java` file inside the folder `src/test/java`.

Conventionally, a test class has the word "Test" in its name, either preceding or following the class name the tests are written for.  

Each method that is annotated with `@Test` is a **unit test**. 

<div class="note">

A "unit test" is a term used in software engineering to refer to a test written to examine the smallest block of code that can be isolated for testing. In most programming languages, such a "unit" is a function/method.

</div>

Notice, to use `@Test` annotation; to use it, you must have the following import at the top of your source code. 

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
```

IntelliJ is equipped with a plugin that facilitates running JUnit tests. For example, you can click on the green play arrow next to each test to run it.
