# Path

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Identify a path from a source vertex to a destination vertex.

<div class="note">

A **path** is a sequence of consecutive edges in a graph. 

</div>

Alternatively, we can define "path" as a sequence of vertices where each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to it. 

Consider the following graph:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/27/graph01.png" width="50%">
</div>

Here are two paths from $A$ to $C$: $(A, C)$ and $(A, B, D, C)$.

<div class="note">

A **simple path** is a path that does not repeat any nodes or edges.

</div>

In this class, when I say "path," I mean "simple path."

**Aside:** In some references, what I defined as "path" is described as "walk," and instead "simple path" is called, simply, "path."

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> List the edges on a **directed path** from $B$ to $E$ and from $C$ to $E$.

<summary>Solution</summary>

* Directed path from $B$ to $E$: $((B, D), (D, E))$.
* There is no directed path from $C$ to $E$.
