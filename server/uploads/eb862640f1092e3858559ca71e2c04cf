* Describe the Stack ADT.

</details></div>

A Stack ADT supports two main operations:

* **Push** which adds an element to the data structure.
* **Pop** which removes <u>the most recently added element</u> that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements are removed gives rise to the term **LIFO** (last in, first out) to describe a stack.

It helps to think of a stack as an ADT where operations are done on one end of the collection and access to all other positions is restricted.

A stack has a variety of applications such as:

* Function call stack in program execution.
* Reversing the order of elements.
* Undo mechanism (e.g., undo functionality in text editors).
* Evaluating/parsing expressions (e.g., reverse polish notations).
