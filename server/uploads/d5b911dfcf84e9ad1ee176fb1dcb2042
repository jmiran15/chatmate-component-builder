# Set ADT

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Explain and trace the core operations of **Set ADT**.
* Implement the core operations of Set efficiently using array/linked structure.
* Analyze the time/space efficiency of alternative implementation approaches (e.g., array vs. linked structure)
* Understand "move-to-front" and "transpose sequential search" *heuristics* well enough to implement them.
* Implement **Fail-Fast** iterators for the Set ADT.
* Explain the difference between the Set and the **OrderedSet ADT**.
* Implement the core operations of OrderedSet efficiently using array/linked structure.
* Describe set-theoretical operations *union*, *intersection*, and *set difference*.
