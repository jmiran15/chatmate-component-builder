# Multiple Inheritance?

- Differentiate between multiple vs. single inheritance.
- Differentiate between multiple vs. multi-level inheritance.

</details></div>

Multiple inheritance is where one class has more than one super-class and inherits features from all parent classes.

Some programming languages, like C++ and Ruby, support Multiple Inheritance. <span class="highlight">Java, however, does not support multiple inheritance.</span> Java does not permit you to extend more than one class. Although, a super-class itself may be a sub-class (of another class higher up in the hierarchy), allowing multi-level inheritance.

<div class="note">

The reasons for not permitting multiple inheritance are primarily technical (compiler design) and, at this point, historical artifacts. You can refer to [Oracle's Java Tutorial: Inheritance](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/multipleinheritance.html) for _their_ explanation of why Multiple Inheritance is not permitted.

Note that it is perfectly okay for a class to have multiple sub-classes.

* TutorialsPoint has a well-written entry on inheritance, with a nice diagram for types of it, [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_inheritance.htm).
