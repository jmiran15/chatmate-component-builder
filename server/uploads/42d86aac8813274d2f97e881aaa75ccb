* Explain how to implement Prim's algorithm.

A [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) that grows an MST from a starting source vertex until it spans the entire graph:

* Start with an empty minimum spanning tree $T = \\{\\}$.
* Pick a vertex $v$ (at random) and add it to $T$.
* Choose a vertex $u$ not in $T$, such that the edge weight from a vertex in $T$ to $u$ is the least among all such edges.
* Add $u$ to $T$. 
* Repeat the last two steps until $(N – 1)$ edges were added.
