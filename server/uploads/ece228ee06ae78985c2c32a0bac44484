# Graph Search Problem: Modify the Goal

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Describe a variant of the general Graph Search problem that finds a path between a source and every reachable vertex.

</details></div>

Recall:

<div class="note">

**General Graph Search Problem**

**Input**: Graph $G=(V, E)$, and a starting vertex $s \in V$.\
**Goal:** Identify the vertices in $V$ <u>reachable</u> from $s$ in $G$.

</div>

We slightly modify the objective as follows:

<div class="note">

**Goal:** Identify a <u>path</u> from $s$ to each (reachable) vertex in $G$. 

</div>

We will see how we can modify the solution to the General Graph Search Problem to solve the modified version of it.
