# Quicksort: The Big Picture!

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Explain and trace the quicksort algorithm on a particular data sequence.

</details></div>

In Quicksort, we **partition** the sequence into two subsequences separated by a single element $x$ that is greater than or equal to every element in the left subsequence and less than or equal to every element in the right subsequence.

<div class="note">

After partitioning, the element $x$, called the **pivot** element, is in its final (sorted) position.

</div>

We now apply the partitioning to the two subsequences separately. This process is naturally recursive (and quick).
