The **Graph Search** problem, in a nutshell, is figuring out if a graph contains a path from one vertex to another.

Many fundamental algorithms on graphs (e.g., finding shortest path, cycles, connected components, $\dots$) are applications of the graph search problem.

**General Graph Search Problem**

**Input**: Graph $G=(V, E)$, and a starting vertex $s \in V$.\
**Goal:** Identify the vertices in $V$ <u>reachable</u> from $s$ in $G$.

</div>

For example, consider the following graph: (It's one graph with multiple connected components!)

The set of vertices reachable from $s$ is $\\{s, u, v, w\\}$.
