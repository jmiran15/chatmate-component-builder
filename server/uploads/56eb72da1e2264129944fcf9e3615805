# AVL Tree

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Elaborate on the purpose of **structural rotation**.
* Describe, trace and implement structural rotations: **single right, single left, double right-left, and double left-right**.
* Explain and trace the balancing operations of an **AVL tree**.
* <u>Select the appropriate rotation type</u> to rebalance an AVL tree after an insertion/removal operation is performed.
* Implement the core operations of OrderedMap efficiently with an AVL tree.
* Analyze the time/space efficiency of an AVL tree.

> This chapter does not have a starter/solution code because a homework is about implementing an AVL tree.
