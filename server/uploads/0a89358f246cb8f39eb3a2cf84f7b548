# Tree & Tree Traversal

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Explain and trace (binary) Tree Traversals (level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
* Implement various tree traversals.
* Define tree-related terminologies: *Path*, *Height*, *Depth*, *Level*.
* Explain why the height of a **full binary tree** is $\Omicron(\lg N)$.
* Distinguish between *best-case* vs. *worst-case* running time of operations on BST.
* Differentiate general (rooted) tree from a binary tree
* Recognize applications of general-purpose tree
* Recognize "Array of References" and "Leftmost-Childâ€“Right-Sibling" representations of the general-purpose tree.
