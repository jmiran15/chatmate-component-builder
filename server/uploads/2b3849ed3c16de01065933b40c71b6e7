# Types of Edge

* Distinguish between loops and multigraph and pseudograph.

Consider this graph:

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/26/graph06.png" width="80%">
</div>

<br>

An edge can attach a vertex to itself (like $\\{ B,B \\}$); this is called a **loop**. A graph that contains loops is called a *pseudograph*.

There can be **multiple** edges (a.k.a parallel edges) between the same end-points (like $\\{C,D \\}$, which is a double edge). Graphs that have parallel edges are called *multigraph*. 

<div class="note">

A **simple** graph is one where there are no loops or multiple edges.

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> What kind of a graph is this?
 
<div class="center">

</div>

A) Directed multigraph \
B) Directed pseudograph \
C) Simple directed graph \
D) Simple undirected graph

<summary>Solution</summary>

A simple directed graph. 

The edges between $C$ and $B$ are directed (opposite direction), so it is not multiple-edge; thus not a multigraph.

</details>

**Aside:** Not every vertex has to have an edge attached to it. 
A vertex with no edges is called an **isolated vertex**.

A graph that has an isolated vertex is not "connected." 

<div class="note">

In a **connected graph**, it is possible to get from every vertex in the graph to every other vertex through a series of edges.
