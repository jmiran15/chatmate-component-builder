# Graph Search

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Define the **neighborhood** of a vertex.
* Identify a **path** from a source vertex to a destination vertex.
* State the **General Graph Search** problem.
* Identify **reachable** vertices in a graph from a source vertex.
* Identify a general solution to the general graph search problem.
* Generate and trace Graph search types by specifying how to explore the neighbor in the general search algorithm.
* Describe, trace, and implement the **Breadth-First Search** algorithm.
* Describe, trace, and implement the **Depth-First Search** algorithm.
* Identify which data structure supports each traversal/search type: breadth-first, depth-first
* Analyze the time complexity of BFS and DFS for each Graph implementation (list vs. matrix)
