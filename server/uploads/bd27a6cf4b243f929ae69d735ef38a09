# Exercise

* Implement IndexedList operations with a (singly) linked list implementation (LinkedIndexedList).

</details></div>

Open the starter code and look for the `LinkedIndexedList.java` file. This file is a linked list implementation of IndexedList ADT. 

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Complete the implementation of `LinkedIndexedList` (at home!)

Note here we <u>cannot</u> start with an empty list. Instead, we must build a complete list (with the given size and the default value) in the `LinkedIndexedList` constructor.

<div class="note">

We have written our unit tests based on the specification of the IndexedList ADT. Therefore, we can use the same suite of tests to test both implementations of IndexedList (that is `ArrayIndexedList` and `LinkedIndexedList`). We need to switch between these two implementations. Open the starter code and find out how this is done by leveraging inheritance. (Hint: look for the abstract method `createUnit`).
