# Unit Testing: Summary

* Appreciate the value of Unit Testing and Test-First Development in software construction.

Unit testing is the practice of testing individual units or components of an application to validate that each of those units is working correctly. In this course, it means testing every operation (method) of all implementations of an ADT. We will do this for every ADT.

In general, the anatomy of each unit test involves three logical steps:

1. **Arrange** everything we need to run the test. For example, instantiate an object with some parameters.
2. **Act** to set the test in motion; invoke the method to be tested (with some input).
3. **Assert** the output (effects) of the method under test checks against the expected outcome.

JUnit is a unit testing framework in Java that provides us with utilities to write, run, and automate unit testing.

### Unit Testing & Software Testing

Unit Testing is just one of the many different software testing strategies. You can read more on Software Testing at [Software Testing Fundamentals Website](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/)

It must be noted that software testing is not a substitute for [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification). Formal verification means **proving** that your code/algorithm/process does what it is supposed to do.

### Test-First Development

In this class, we follow a widespread software development practice known as Test-First Development. 

<div class="note">

Test first development is a practice where you write the unit tests before writing the code to test.

Don Wells has a great article, [Code the Unit Test First](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html), where he elaborates on the values of this practice.

<div class="note">

Test-First Development is closely related to another, more popular software development practice called [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) or TDD.
