# Union-Find Data Structure

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

- Identify the operations of the **Union-Find data structure**.
- Trace the **quick find** implementation strategy for union-find.
- Trace the **quick union** implementation strategy for union-find.
- Differentiate the advantages/disadvantages of quick find vs. quick union.
- Trace the "quick union" implementation with **union-by-size** and **path compression** heuristics.
- Explain the runtime improvements gained by using the heuristics for union-find operations.
- Define the **iterated logarithm** (log-star) function.
- Identify the *amortized* runtime of union-find operations.
- Explain how to implement Kruskal's algorithm efficiently using a union-find structure to detect cycles. Identify the resulting time complexity.
