# Structural Rotation: Definition

* Elaborate on the purpose of structural rotation.

Consider these numbers: $3, 5, 7$. The following are valid binary search trees made up of the given numbers. However, only one is "balanced."

<div class="center">
<img src="/img/19/avl01.png" width="100%"><br/>
<img src="/img/19/avl02.png" width="100%"><br/>
<img src="/img/19/avl03.png" width="100%"><br/>
<img src="/img/19/avl04.png" width="100%"><br/>
<img src="/img/19/avl05.png" width="100%">
</div>

The four unbalanced trees can be _transformed_ to the balanced one using **structural rotation**. (Notice the balanced one can be generated from the sequence $5, 3, 7$ or $5, 7, 3$.)

<div class="note">

A structural rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the tree's structure without affecting the order of the elements (as read in by an in-order traversal).

</div>

A structural rotation is often employed to balance two branches of different depths. 

In a structural rotation, one node is shifted up, another is shifted down, and some of the remaining nodes may be shifted to ensure the tree is still a binary tree (each node only has two branches). 

<div class="note">

Structural rotations change the height of the tree by moving up larger subtrees.
