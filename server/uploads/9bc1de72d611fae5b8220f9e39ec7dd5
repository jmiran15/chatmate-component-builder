# Tree Terminology: Height

The **height** of a node $n$ is the _length_ of a _longest path_ from $n$ to a leaf.

<div class="note">

The height of a tree is the height of its root.

</div>

We can _recursively_ define the height of a node:

$$
\text{height}(n)=\left \\{ \begin{matrix} 0 & n = \text{leaf} \\\ 1 + \max(\text{height of children}) & n \neq \text{leaf} \end{matrix} \right \\}
$$

**Aside**: In some references, the height of a node includes the node.  In that case, the height of a leaf is 1.
