# RAM model of Computation

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

* Describe what is meant by **efficiency** of algorithms.
* Explain the purpose of using the **RAM model of computation** for the analysis of algorithms.
* Identify what counts as a "step" in an algorithm.
* Explain how algorithm runtime is calculated under the RAM model of computation.
* Describe runtime by counting up the number of RAM instructions for a given code snippet.
* Recognize the importance of **input size** on evaluating algorithm efficiency.
* Know that what we choose to call the size of input can vary from problem to problem.
* Differentiate between the **best-case** vs the **worst-case** analysis.
* Explain why we focus on the worst-case analysis.
* Express the number of steps for a given code segment as a function of the input size in the worst-case scenario.
* Appreciate that it can be very difficult to work out precisely the exact number of steps (RAM instructions) in an algorithm.
