# Heap Order Property

<div id="outcomes"><details><summary></summary>

* Describe the order property of a binary heap.

</details></div>

The ordering can be one of two types:

* The **min-heap** property: the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children, with the minimum-value element at the root.\
(Here, "best" means "smallest.")

* The **max-heap** property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its children, with the maximum-value element at the root.\
(Here, "best" means "largest.")

<span class="tag">Exercise</span> Which of the following is a valid binary **max** heap?

The two on the top are valid binary max heaps, but the bottom two are not. The bottom left is a min-heap. The bottom right violates the heap order property (200 should be at the root).
