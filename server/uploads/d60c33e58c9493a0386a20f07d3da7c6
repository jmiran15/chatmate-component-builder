# Abstract Data Type

* Define what is an Abstract Data Type (ADT).

</details></div>


Recall the definitions of "data type" and "data structure" from previous chapters:

> A **data type** consists of a _type_ (a collection of values) together with a collection of _operations_ to manipulate the type.

> A **data structure** encapsulates organized mechanisms for efficiently storing, accessing & manipulating data. 

Recall that I have previously mentioned any data type (even as simple as an integer) can be viewed as a simple data structure in the general sense.

Now, I introduce the concept of **Abstract Data Types**, sometimes abbreviated as **ADT**.

<div class="note">

ADT is a description (representation) of some (type of) data and the operations that are allowed on that data, while abstracting (ignoring) implementation details.

</div>

ADT simply provides <span class="highlight">a _minimal_ expected _interface_ and set of behaviors</span> without regard to how they will be implemented.

<div class="note">

A data structure is an implementation of an ADT.

</div>

ADTs are used in the study of data structures, design and analysis of algorithms, programming languages, and software engineering.

* ADTs are a theoretical concept. They are often described in terms of [algebraic specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_specification) with axioms that formalize the operations and their expected behaviors.

* Most programming languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. In programming languages that support object-oriented programming, the abstract class construct comes close to the specification of an ADT. 

For example, the abstract class `Roster` can be seen as an ADT for "roster" which lays out the interface of its core operations `add`, `remove` and `find`. It is essential that these operations are not implemented (otherwise, it would not be an ADT). The responsibility of implementing the core operations falls on the _data structures_ `MoocRoster` and `JhuRoster`.

<div class="note">

To specify an ADT, we need to supplement the abstract class construct with proper documentation and a suite of tests. We will explore these in later lessons and chapters.

I found Eric Elliott's post on Medium [Abstract Data Types and the Software Crisis](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/abstract-data-types-and-the-software-crisis-671ea7fc72e7) an interesting read. You may want to check it out.
