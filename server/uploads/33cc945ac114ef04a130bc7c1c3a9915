# Graph Basics

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

- Identify the various components of Graph structures (node/vertex, edge, nodes adjacent to a node, edges incident with a node, etc.).
- Identify the operations of Graph ADT.
- Describe adjacency/incidence list vs. matrix-based representation of a graph.
- Analyze and compare the complexity of basic operations for adjacency list vs. matrix-based representations of a graph.
