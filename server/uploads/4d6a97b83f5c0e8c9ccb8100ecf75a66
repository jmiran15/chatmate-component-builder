# Minimum Spanning Tree

After reading this chapter and engaging in the embedded activities and reflections, you should be able to:

- In the context of Graph Theory, define Cycle, Acyclic Graph, and Tree.
- Describe what a spanning tree is and why constructing minimum spanning trees is useful.
- Trace Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.
- Trace Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.
- Explain how to implement Prim's algorithm, comparing various approaches to finding the next min edge and the resulting time/space tradeoffs between them.
- Explain how to implement Kruskal's algorithm, comparing various approaches to checking for cycles and the resulting time/space tradeoffs between them.
